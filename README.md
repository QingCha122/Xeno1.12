# Xeno1.12
## Information
* Based on https://github.com/N1nt4nd0/Xenobyte/
* Special thanks to: N1nt4nd0 (original Xenobyte 1.7.10), Photon (base port to 1.12), CloudFire25 and SenpaiGG (some packethacks), helloHIBANA and his friends (testing)...
* Info: I find Photon port to 1.12 and finish it (fill it with packethacks, fix some stuff)...
* Tested on: Windows...
* For fixes contact in Discord...
## Building
* You should change consts at `theic2.xenobyteport.api.Configuration` and `theic2.xenobyteport.api.Xeno` to make it undetectable by some stupid anticheats.
* Build: `gradlew build`
* TODO: own DLL/SO-based loader...
## Contributing
* Feel free to make any PRs...
